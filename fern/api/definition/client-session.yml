            Creating a client session generates a client token: a temporary key used to initialize Universal Checkout and authenticate it against your account.
            Universal Checkout automatically retrieves all the settings from the client session and the Dashboard to configure the payment methods and the checkout experience.

            Note:
            When creating a Client Session, please make sure to provide currencyCode, orderId, and at least one of amount or lineItems.
            If any of these are not yet available, you can provide them when making the payment request.
            POST /client-session does not have required fields as all fields are not always known when a client session is created.
            Use PATCH /client-session to update the parameters throughout the checkout session.

            Client tokens expire after 24 hours.

            The only required field for the request is clientToken. Other supported request fields are same as for the POST /client-session API call.
            You need to specify only the fields you wish to update. However, if the items that are to be updated are of type array, then you need to provide the complete array along with modified items.
            If you wish to update nested fields on the client session, such as the customer emailAddress field, you can pass the customer object with only one field, emailAddress, to update.
            If you simply wish to clear the value of the field, pass null as your input.
            You can update paymentMethod.vaultOnSuccess field but updating of the paymentMethod.options field through PATCH /client-session is not supported.
            The response will contain all the fields of the client session including the ones that were changed.
