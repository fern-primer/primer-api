        create:
          docs: |
            Create and authorize a payment for a given customer order. 
            You should provide a payment method token here to avoid PCI implications.
            If only a payment method token is passed, the values passed with the Client Session is used to determine the amount, currency etc.
            Note: amount, currencyCode and orderId are required during payment creation.
            Make sure to pass these fields when creating a client session, or if not yet available, when creating a payment.
            All fields provided on this request will take preference over any field on the order associated with the client session. 
            E.g. if you pass amount on this request, it will override the amount on the order associated with the Client Session.

        capture:
          docs: |
            If you have successfully authorized a payment, you can now
            fully capture, or partially capture funds from the authorized payment, depending
            on whether your selected payment processor supports it. The payment will
            be updated to SETTLED or SETTLING, depending on the payment method type.

            The payload sent in this capture request is completely optional. If you don't
            send a payload with the capture request, the full amount that was authorized
            will be sent for capture. Below are the available payload attributes, which
            give you more granular control when capturing funds, if you require it.
          method: POST

          docs: | 
            Provided the payment has not reached `SETTLED` status, Primer will
            send a "void" request to the payment processor, thereby cancelling the payment
            and releasing the hold on customer funds. Upon success, the payment will transition
            to `CANCELLED`. The payload is optional.
          method: POST
          path: /{id}/cancel
          path-parameters:
